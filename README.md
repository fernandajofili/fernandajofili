## Hi! 👋 I'm Fernanda  🙋‍♀️

I am an engineer and developer who found in programming a way to solve everyday problems (that sometimes only exist in my mind 🤷).

- I'm currently working as an **ABAP developer**, a very interesting language used in SAP ERP.
- I also work as **Community Manager at Platzi** for their leg in [Brazil](https://platzi.com.br/).
- I'm studying **System's Analysis & Development**, focusing on Java.

My interests include:
- **Databases** 🎲
- **Python** 🐍
- **Data Science** 🔍
- Artificial Intelligence 💻

You can talk to me in English, Portuguese, Spanish and German (although I'm not even close to understand a full sentence in German, I'll do my best to communicate with you 😁).
