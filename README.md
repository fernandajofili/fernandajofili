Hi, I'm Fernanda, I am an engineer who loves to study algorithms, data and how to make education more affordable and interesting to people in Latin America.

I'm currently working as Course Director at [Platzi](https://platzi.com/) and [Platzi Brasil](https://platzi.com.br/) - this means that I help experts to design high-quality courses that engage the community to keep developing its skills in software developing, design, marketing, entrepreneurship and more. If you believe you can help the community with your knowledge and expertise, reach me out.

The majority of my code here is some algorithms I like to study and some analysis I do. You can also find some projects I developed for my university's subjects.

My main interest is to improve my analytics skills, that's why I'm always using Python üêç and creating queries üîç
